Notes about Python

    Python code is executed line by line from top to bottom, similar to most other programming languages.

    Python uses whitespace (indentation) to define blocks of code instead of curly braces like other programming languages.

    Semicolons (;) are not required to end statements in Python, but can be used to separate statements on the same line.

    If multiple variables have the same name, the last assignment will be the one used when the variable is referenced.

    Python is an interpreted language, meaning that the code is not compiled to machine code before execution, but rather translated and executed at runtime.

    Python is dynamically typed, meaning that the type of a variable is determined at runtime, based on the value it is assigned.

    Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

    Python has a large standard library with many useful modules for tasks like working with files, networking, web development, scientific computing, and more.

    Python is an open-source language, and has a large and active community of developers contributing to its development and ecosystem.

    Python is widely used in a variety of fields including data science, machine learning, web development, scientific computing, and more.
