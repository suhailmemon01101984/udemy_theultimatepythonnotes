'''
In this code snippet, a lambda function is defined and 
assigned to the variable multiply. A lambda function is a small anonymous 
function that can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

In this case, the lambda function takes two arguments, 
x and y, and returns their product x * y.

After the lambda function is defined, 
it is called with the arguments 3 and 4 using the multiply variable, 
and the product of 3 and 4, which is 12, is printed to the console 
using the print() function.


So when the code is executed, the output will be 12.

multiply = lambda x, y: x * y
print(multiply(3, 4))  # Output: 12
