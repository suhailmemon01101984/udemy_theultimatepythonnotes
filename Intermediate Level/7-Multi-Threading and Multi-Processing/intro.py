# Multi-Threading and Multi-Processing

'''
Multi-threading and multi-processing are two techniques used in Python to achieve concurrent execution of code. 
The difference between them lies in how they utilize system resources such as CPU and memory.

Multi-threading is a technique where multiple threads run concurrently within a single process. 
Each thread shares the same memory space, which can lead to race conditions and other issues if not implemented properly. 
Multi-threading is best used for tasks that involve a lot of I/O operations, such as file I/O or network I/O.

Multi-processing, on the other hand, is a technique where multiple processes run concurrently. 
Each process has its own memory space, which makes it safer and easier to work with than multi-threading. 
Multi-processing is best used for CPU-bound tasks, such as scientific computing or data analysis.
